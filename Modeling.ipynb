Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to\\n  6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.\\n      The Fed\\'s failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday\\n  and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data\\n  released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.\\n      The Fed\\'s absence may be explained by the lack of any\\n  pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to\\n  boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to\\n  meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.\\n      Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week\\n  borrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually\\n  averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that\\n  was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.\\n      Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for\\n  two-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln\\n  dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of\\n  around 6.10 pct.\\n      It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings\\n  target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said\\n  Wells Fargo\\'s Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on\\n  the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to\\n  6-1/4 pct band.\\n      Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need\\n  are anticipated for the statement period that began today.\\n   More\\n      Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four\\n  billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro\\n  puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.\\n      To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to\\n  add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to\\n  buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar\\n  coupon \"pass\" may be required later.\\n      There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement\\n  period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further\\n  upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window\\n  dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

It regards a\\n  stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate\\n  policies to influence the exchange rate.\\n      The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate\\n  aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands.\\n      Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.\\n      Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: \"By\\n  maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the\\n  expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it\\n  suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to\\n  obtain.\"\\n      Amro\\'s Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest\\n  rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of\\n  securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital\\n  market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring\\n  about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he\\n  added.\\n      Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is\\n  a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central\\n  Bank\\'s policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters,\\n  noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with\\n  the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency.\\n      \"It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference\\n  between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate,\" he added.\\n      Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the\\n  Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows\\n  between the two countries, as the economic performance of the\\n  two does not differ much, economists said.\\n      Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the\\n  Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they\\n  accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two\\n  countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the\\n  Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month.\\n      Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest\\n  and exchange rates.\\n      West Germany is the Netherlands\\' largest single trading\\n  partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of\\n  imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of\\n  Statistics figures show.\\n      At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits\\n  trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a\\n  rate of around 5-7/16 pct.\\n      Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will\\n  even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in\\n  1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany.\\n      In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to\\n  decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch\\n  Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.\\n  German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation\\n  between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts.\\n      But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money\\n  dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates\\n  independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank.\\n      Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22,\\n  the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5\\n  pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit\\n  surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had\\n  expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.\\n      The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact\\n  on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.\\n      While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its\\n  policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range\\n  narrow.\\n      \"The European Monetary System is not only a relationship\\n  between the guilder and the mark.

By January, its estimate of 1986\\n  planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.\\n      Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in\\n  1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year\\'s good\\n  demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts\\n  said those factors make cotton a profitable crop.\\n      \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is\\n  going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.\\n  Soybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill\\n  Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton\\n  market specialists.\\n      Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to\\n  increased acreage, analysts said.\\n      They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers\\n  who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans\\n  were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in\\n  government warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government\\n  will not pick up the tab for storage.\\n      Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from\\n  participating in the program, which could result in more\\n  cotton. \"The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of\\n  25 pct of a farmer\\'s base acreage,\" noted Judy Weissman of\\n  Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to\\n  participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage \\n  they have.\\n      Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding\\n  Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the\\n  program. \"Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,\" said\\n  one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part\\n  on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its\\n  annual meeting in late January.\\n      But others disagreed. \"I think some Western growers have\\n  decided they should be in the program for security reasons.\\n  There\\'s a lot of comfort in knowing you\\'ll be guaranteed the\\n  government\\'s loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the\\n  program is subject to the wiles of the market,\" said Walter\\n  Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.\\n      Some cotton specialists said their expectations for\\n  increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday\\'s planting\\n  intentions report. \"Anything the USDA is announcing now is\\n  based on information they gathered before their cotton program\\n  was announced (on March 20),\" one analyst cautioned. She said\\n  traders will get a better idea of next year\\'s cotton output\\n  when the USDA\\'s planted acreage report is released on July 9.\\n      Brown took that opinion a step further. \"I don\\'t think\\n  planted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment\\n  rate,\" the difference between acreage planted and acreage\\n  harvested.\\n      Brown said the abandonment rate this year was \"pretty high\"\\n  at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing\\n  states. \"More normal would be about six pct,\" he said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

At present pre-market trading is almost\\n  exclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be\\n  done during the sterling rings, they added.\\n      LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more\\n  closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the\\n  recent wide backwardations.\\n      Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct\\n  purity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc\\n  countries, such as Romania.\\n      The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined\\n  as an exporter recently, they said.\\n      Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from\\n  liquidity problems initially, as business may continue to\\n  centre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where\\n  there are many holders of large short positions on the LME.\\n      But others said the new contract would soon attract trading\\n  interest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been\\n  attracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations.\\n      The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a\\n  new contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where\\n  high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they\\n  said.\\n      Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will\\n  eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like\\n  standard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract,\\n  gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process\\n  in this case may take longer, they added.\\n      Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore\\n  warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations,\\n  which make physical trading difficult, would not totally\\n  disappear as a result, the trade sources said.\\n      These premiums for prompt metal have become a\\n  semi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased\\n  business and volatility in traded options, and are presently\\n  around 50 stg.\\n      Increasingly large granting of option positions has been\\n  taking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at\\n  the end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes\\n  around these dates are commonplace, they said.\\n      Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern\\n  operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of\\n  having to cover.\\n      But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even\\n  though the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between the\\n  declaration and prompt dates.\\n      These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the\\n  month, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th.\\n      Backwardations will remain while operators continue to\\n  grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds\\n  aluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said.\\n  \\n\\n\",\n",

It recommended that to stop friction\\n  due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must \"make a historical\\n  transformation in its traditional policies on economic\\n  management and the nation\\'s lifestyle. There can be no further\\n  development for Japan without this transformation.\"\\n      Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have\\n  looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change.

Japanese\\n  officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic\\n  demand will be ready in early April. Until last week, there\\n  were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon.\\n      The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congress\\n  over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billion\\n  dlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results from\\n  Japan, dramatic action is required.\\n      Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on\\n  certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere\\n  to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries.\\n      The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appease\\n  mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes just\\n  two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review\\n  the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies.\\n      And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade\\n  surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the\\n  need for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials.\\n      Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in the\\n  deficit. \"I\\'d be stunned if we were not going to derive some\\n  benefits (from the lower dollar) soon,\" said one.\\n      In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate\\n  closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting\\n  \"underlying economic fundamentals\" or economic reality.\\n      The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan\\n  and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United\\n  States cutting its budget deficit.\\n      The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada,\\n  agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade\\n  imbalances.\\n      But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying\\n  fundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one.\\n      Markets, in effect, are less confident than governments\\n  that these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cuts\\n  agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out.\\n      Nonetheless, the dollar\\'s sharp fall has not undermined \\n  cooperation.

It was a\\n  \"pointed reminder\" to Japan to do something about the trade\\n  issues, the source said of the dollar\\'s fall against the yen.\\n      By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris\\n  accord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability\\n  around current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar.\\n      Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target for\\n  the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to\\n  their international responsibilities and stimulate growth.\\n      But U.S. officials said recent market developments will not\\n  unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement.\\n      \"There\\'s a realisation now that you cannot leave things\\n  alone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalances\\n  ought to be adjusted,\" one official said.\\n      \"While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, we\\n  certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,\"\\n  another U.S. official said.\\n      The officials said the meeting here, where the six will be\\n  joined by Italy, will be a status report.\\n      \"Japan will have to explain what the state of their program\\n  is and Germany will report on its plans.

Its surplus rose to 8.14\\n  billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January.\\n      Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade\\n  deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to\\n  the dollar\\'s decline in world currency markets as a reason to\\n  press Japan to buy more U.S. goods.\\n      They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration\\n  in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology.\\n      In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S.\\n  semiconductor industry, President Reagan Friday announced he\\n  intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese\\n  electronic goods in retaliation for Japan\\'s failure to abide by\\n  a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement.\\n      Congress also has been been angered by the administration\\'s\\n  lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues\\n  including beef, citrus, automobile parts, telecommunications\\n  goods, and financial services.\\n      The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in\\n  four committees. It is a package of trade sanctions and\\n  measures to force the administration take tough action against\\n  foreign trade barriers and unfair competition.\\n      Although most provisions do not single out Japan, in many\\n  cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese\\n  products or make them more expensive with higher duties.\\n      The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House\\n  Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2. Its focus is to\\n  force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign\\n  competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win\\n  temporary relief from surges in imports.\\n      The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict\\n  imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not\\n  buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.\\n      Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Democratic presidential aspirant\\n  from Missouri, has the support of Wright and other key\\n  Democrats to press for passage of the amendment.\\n      The measure would have the most impact on Japan, West\\n  Germany, Taiwan and South Korea. If Japan, for example, does\\n  not reduce its barriers by mid-1988, the United States would\\n  set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per\\n  cent a year for three years.\\n      \"I\\'m tired of going into companies and having managers say\\n  to me, \\'We\\'re not over competing in Japan because we can\\'t\\n  compete in the marketplace.\\' That argument needs to be taken\\n  away from American business,\" Gephardt said.\\n      The administration has said it could not support a trade\\n  bill containing such a provision.\\n      \\n  \\n\\n',\n",

The initial rate was also to be initially set on\\n  April 15, and quarterly after that, at 340 basis points below\\n  the same 90-day New Zealand rate.\\n      Because the Dow Chemical notes carried an interest rate\\n  floor of 17 pct, the issue saw strong investor demand,\\n  underwriters said.\\n      But the Ford Credit notes and Friday\\'s offering of 130 mln\\n  New Zealand dlrs of floating-rate notes due 1990 issued by\\n  General Electric Co\\'s &lt;GE> General Electric Credit Corp via\\n  Prudential-Bache Securities Inc, did not have such a floor.\\n      \"Obviously, the two firms did not want to issue floaters\\n  and face the risk of New Zealand rates falling sharply,\" an\\n  underwriter away from the syndicates said.

They were willing to\\n  absorb foreign currency risk until mid-1986, when sharp slides\\n  posted by the Australian and New Zealand dollars brought such\\n  issuance to a quick halt.\\n      It was not until late last year, after the currencies\\n  stabilized, that companies again started issuing debt\\n  denominated in Australian and New Zealand dollars.\\n      But many investors have still shied away from the debt,\\n  remembering the mid-1986 downturn of the Australian and New\\n  Zealand dollars, analysts noted.\\n      To attract some of those investors back to the fold,\\n  underwriters like Bear Stearns decided to structure the foreign\\n  currency issues as floating rate debt, sources said.\\n      This occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty over the\\n  course of U.S. interest rates for the intermediate term, and\\n  predictions by a number of economists that Treasury yields\\n  would rise in the second half of the year, the sources noted.\\n      A Bear Stearns officer said more than half of the Ford\\n  Credit notes were sold by late Friday afternoon, the second day\\n  of offering. \"That is quicker than some recent fixed-rate New\\n  Zealand dollar note issues,\" he said.\\n      However, underwriters away from the Bear Stearns syndicate\\n  said the issue may have sold even faster if Prudential-Bache\\n  did not offer the General Electric Credit notes on Friday.\\n      They pointed out that the Ford notes were rated A-1 by\\n  Moody\\'s Investors and AA-minus by Standard and Poor\\'s, while\\n  the General Electric notes, which had the same interest rate\\n  terms and were also non-callable to maturity, carried\\n  top-flight AAA ratings by both agencies.\\n      \"We have sold 20 to 25 pct of the GE notes.

But he said\\n  it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half\\n  point, to avoid hurting the dollar further.\\n      All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market\\n  Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.\\n      The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly\\n  quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury\\n  bond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which\\n  banks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime\\n  lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.\\n      Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to\\n  the April-June quarter, follow:\\n      - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further\\n  against other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget\\n  deficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after\\n  the dollar\\'s steep drop in the last two business days, the\\n  economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that\\n  the dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.\\n      - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue\\n  trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well\\n  test the lower end of that range.\\n      - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and\\n  probably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong\\n  foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The\\n  outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year\\n  since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.\\n      - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator\\n  will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The\\n  sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will\\n  a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.\\n      - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct\\n  annual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at\\n  respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first\\n  and second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct\\n  annual\\n  rate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.\\n      Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees\\n  both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among\\n  those surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct\\n  rate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this\\n  quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.\\n      \"The economy will bounce back more strongly than many\\n  expect,\" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in\\n  inventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter\\n  economic growth, with consumer spending helping later.\\n      \"We\\'re running out of special factors to keep the economy\\n  afloat,\" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His\\n  interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.\\n      Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation\\n  helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.\\n  He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second\\n  quarter growth could be zero or negative.\\n      Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer\\n  from a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow \\n  government spending and less construction. Only a marginally\\n  narrower trade deficit will add to growth.\\n      He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,\\n  with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,\\n  respectively. Nikko\\'s Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for\\n  bonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.\\n      Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly\\n  after the dollar\\'s fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past\\n  days and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.\\n      David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc\\n  raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20\\n  pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.\\n      Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted\\n  his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point\\n  to eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and\\n  Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.\\n      The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese\\n  investors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear\\n  about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.\\n  trade sanctions.

It imposed daily and weekly purchase\\n  limits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets\\n  and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of\\n  total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This\\n  will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the\\n  world\\'s fourth largest producer, undermining the market.\\n      The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer\\n  Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.\\n      A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was\\n  adopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting\\n  countries agreed several changes to make the reference price\\n  more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions\\n  under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance\\n  operations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund\\n  buffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature\\n  of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running\\n  into hundreds of millions of sterling.

Brazil wanted to maintain\\n  its previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and,\\n  although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today,\\n  delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term\\n  negotiations on export quota distribution as remote.\\n      International agreements exist for sugar and wheat.

Common fund for commodities, with a planned\\n  directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to\\n  become operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet\\n  Union has ratified it.

U.S. Officials said it has been willing to\\n  study individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented\\n  commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.\\n      \"We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the\\n  price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,\"\\n  official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently\\n  belongs to only two international commodity agreements that\\n  have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement\\n  (ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat\\n  pacts.\\n      The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement\\n  because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and\\n  not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries,\\n  the State Department said.

But recently demands for more\\n  stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the\\n  need for \"intellectual honesty\" and \"objective criteria\" have\\n  grown.\\n      British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be\\n  a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.\\n      It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct\\n  market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree\\n  of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended\\n  borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.\\n  Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to\\n  reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather\\n  than dictate what prices should be.\\n      A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price\\n  realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.\\n      A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable\\n  to commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of\\n  sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real\\n  market situation, particularly regarding stocks.\\n      Indonesia\\'s Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told\\n  Reuters in Jakarta: \"These agreements can work as long as the\\n  problems are cyclical..But it\\'s another matter when there are\\n  structural problems..But we are still committed to commodity\\n  agreements as an act of faith.\" Nicaraguan External Trade\\n  Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers\\n  cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity\\n  agreements.\\n      \"The political will is not there on the part of some\\n  consumers to make agreements work,\" Martinez Cuenca said.\\n      The head of the economics department in the Brazilian\\n  Foreign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an\\n  agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market\\n  reality.

But liquidity was tight in early business because\\n  banks excessively took up the Bundesbank\\'s offer for sale of\\n  Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for\\n  three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.\\n      Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,\\n  flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return\\n  until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.\\n      Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,\\n  commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five\\n  billion marks or so.\\n      With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the\\n  month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,\\n  draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought\\n  funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess\\n  funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.\\n      One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced\\n  knowledge of the market\\'s needs, should have curtailed its\\n  sales of treasury bills on Friday.\\n      Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total\\n  minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank\\n  has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate\\n  the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.\\n      \"(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not\\n  selling any treasury bills or we\\'re not selling them in this\\n  amount,\" he said. \"If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the\\n  market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will\\n  be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.\"\\n      But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in\\n  rates, given the delicate state of currency markets.\\n      International central banks have been at pains to prevent a\\n  dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark.\\n  Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer\\n  undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar.\\n      \"The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between\\n  three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today\\n  cannot be very popular,\" the senior dealer said.\\n      Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average\\n  rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or\\n  four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned\\n  without the excessive draining through the treasury bill\\n  mechanism.\\n      Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations\\n  between Germany\\'s major employers and the unions, the\\n  Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to\\n  monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said.\\n      Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the\\n  Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion\\n  marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Around a third of\\n  any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the\\n  Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the\\n  dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it\\n  fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of\\n  improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or\\n  because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,\\n  may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget\\n  deficit.\\n     And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will\\n  have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the\\n  gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.\\n  Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O\\'Brien said. The\\n  subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls\\n  on the world stock markets.\\n      \"A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,\"\\n  said O\\'Brien. \"Now, it is much less certain.\"\\n      Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming\\n  economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in\\n  the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and\\n  huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O\\'Brien.\\n      Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith\\n  Barney Harris Upham said  \"We\\'re still in a bull market,\" adding\\n  that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and \"The\\n  bear usually strikes slowly.\"\\n      Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in\\n  London, said the huge sums of money going through the world\\n  financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.\\n      Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in\\n  non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it\\'s very\\n  difficult to see where else they can put their money than in\\n  U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market,\\n  according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi\\n  Securities Co Ltd\\'s bond operation in London.\\n      He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now\\n  to the French franc and West German mark.\\n      In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and\\n  the dollar\\'s slide will mean for securities markets.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

The speculation pushed Borg-Warner\\'s\\n  stock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading.\\n      Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will\\n  stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can\\n  add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF.\\n      \"It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin)\\n  Jacobs that they don\\'t want to be taken over. The question is\\n  now do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they want\\n  to remain independent,\" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps.\\n      Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation\\n  for almost a year. Last week, Jacobs\\' investment vehicle,\\n  Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln\\n  Borg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by\\n  9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding.\\n      Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took no\\n  steps toward a transaction.\\n      \"Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for\\n  the last nine months. It\\'s been one of the dullest corporate\\n  battles I\\'ve seen,\" said one analyst.\\n      The battle, however, has heated up, and the range of\\n  breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market\\n  price to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they\\n  think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate.\\n      Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on\\n  its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner.\\n      Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up\\n  with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials\\n  company in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an\\n  unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefited\\n  from that company\\'s restructuring.\\n      \"Borg Warner can\\'t quibble that it\\'s not a legitimate\\n  offer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of\\n  between a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a\\n  46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it\\'s sweetened. I\\n  personally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per\\n  share,\" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson.\\n      Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a\\n  restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and\\n  Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James\\n  Goldsmith. The company bought back the financier\\'s stock and\\n  carried out a wider share repurchase.\\n      Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman is\\n  seeking \"greenmail,\" or the repurchase of his stock by the\\n  company at a premium.\\n      Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with\\n  financing the transaction.\\n      Previously associated with \"junk bond\" experts, Drexel\\n  Burnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner\\n  takeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender\\n  offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner\\n  board and conditioned on the board\\'s recommendation of the\\n  tender offer and merger.\\n      Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a\\n  merger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees\\n  since the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however,\\n  believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay\\n  debt from the transaction.\\n      GAF\\'s stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8.\\n     \"I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the\\n  level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values\\n  substantially,\" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose.\\n      He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman\\'s average cost for the\\n  company\\'s stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF\\'s\\n  current holdings.\\n      Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business,\\n  which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman.\\n  Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg\\'s earnings.\\n      The plastics are used in telephone equipment, office\\n  equipment and appliances. \"Borg has half the market in the U.S.\\n  and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,\"\\n  Rose said.
